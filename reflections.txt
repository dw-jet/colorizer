1.) I spent around 2 hours working on this project.

2.) The most rewarding challenge was figuring out ways to keep my code DRY.

3.) I think I could take some time to consider semantics before submitting my
projects. I am often just excited to have my code running and turn it in
immediately without really reading it over again.
